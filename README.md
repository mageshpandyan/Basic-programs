# Basic-programs
These are some of the most basic programs/algorithms that I would be uploading on a regular basis provided there's ample time for me. Welcome to my beginner's repo.

# Programs in this rep :
1) Reversing string without reversing the words (using dot as separator).

2) Same as (1) modified with function and better application overall.

3) Returns two prime numbers that are sum of the given number.
