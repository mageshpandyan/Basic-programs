# Basic-programs
Welcome to my beginner's repo.

These are some of the most basic programs/algorithms that I would be uploading on a regular basis provided there's ample time for me. 

Most of them will be in C++ using the Code::Blocks IDE with the C++14 ISO Language standard.


# Programs in this rep :
1) Reversing string without reversing the words (using dot as separator).

2) Same as (1) modified with function and better application overall.

3) Returns two prime numbers that are sum of the given number.

4) Squares a given number without the math function.
