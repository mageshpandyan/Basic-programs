# Basic-programs
Welcome to my beginner's repo.

These are some of the most basic programs/algorithms that I would be uploading on a regular basis provided there's ample time for me. 

Most of them will be in C++ using the Code::Blocks IDE with the C++14 ISO Language standard.


# Programs in this rep :
1) Reversing string without reversing the words (using dot as separator).
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/String%20Reversal%20v1


2) Same as (1) modified with function and better application overall.
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/String%20reversal%20v2

3) Returns two prime numbers that are sum of the given number.
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/Return%20two%20Prime%20numbers.cpp

4) Squares a given number without the math function.
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/SquareOfNumber.cpp

5) Prints numbers in vertical order with n rows and columns.
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/PrintsNumbersInOrder.cpp

6) Reduces three stacks till they're equal at their maximum possible height.
https://github.com/mageshpandyan/Basic-programs/blob/master/StackEqual.cpp

7) Checks if given two integers are an Amicable pair.
